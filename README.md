# World_Weather_Analysis
mock weather analysis for travel advisor company

File includes many analyses such as max temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and wind speed plotted over latitude. There is also a map which displays hotels across the world that fall into user specified temperature ranges (at present.) Finally there is a faux trip planned on the northern coast of Brazil. The programs involve API calls to a weather service and Google maps, and serve primarily as practice in that feature.

Some practice files have been removed due to API exposure; I could re-push the fixed ones, but they're just practice files so I expect it doesn't matter much
